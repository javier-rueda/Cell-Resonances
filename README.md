# Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) Cellular Vibrational Modes Detection
## Overview
Welcome to the Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) Cellular Vibrational Modes Detection project! This GitHub repository hosts the code and resources for a comprehensive exploration of cellular vibrational modes using Atomic Force Microscopy. The project is structured into three main lines of work that are tightly interconnected: Experimental Setup, Data Analysis, and Image Analysis.

##  Project Objectives
 - **Experimental Setup:** Develop and share the codebase for configuring and controlling the AFM setup to acquire high-quality data for cellular vibrational modes. This includes instrument control scripts, calibration procedures, and documentation for hardware integration.

 - **Data Analysis:** Implement robust algorithms and tools for processing and analyzing the raw data obtained from the AFM experiments. This line of work involves signal processing, noise reduction techniques, and feature extraction to identify cellular vibrational modes accurately.

 - **Image Analysis:** Create image processing algorithms to enhance and extract meaningful information from the AFM images. This includes segmentation, feature detection, and visualization techniques to aid in the interpretation of cellular vibrational modes.
