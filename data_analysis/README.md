# Data Analysis

Welcome to the Data Analysis section of the **Cellular Vibration Analysis using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)** project. This directory contains code and resources related to the processing and analysis of raw data obtained from AFM experiments.

## Overview

The data analysis stage is a crucial component of our project, aimed at extracting meaningful insights from the raw AFM data. In this section, we focus on implementing robust algorithms and tools for processing and analyzing the acquired data to identify cellular vibrational modes accurately.

## Project Structure

The 'data analysis' folder is organized as follows:

- **/conditioning**: This directory contains code for conditioning raw data files, making them more accessible and easy to work with in subsequent steps.

- **/simple_harmonic_oscillator**: Here, you'll find the code for fitting the "Simple Harmonic Oscillator with Hydrodynamic Factor" model to the data.

- **/mass_transfer_function**: The more complex code in this directory extends the previous work and involves fitting the "Mass Transfer Function" to the data.

- **/docs**: Find detailed documentation related to the data analysis procedures, including algorithms used, parameter descriptions, and data preprocessing steps.

- **/examples**: Explore example datasets and walkthroughs to understand how to use the data analysis tools effectively.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Data Analysis section:

1. **Explore the Code**:
   - **Conditioning**: Review the code in '/conditioning' for data file conditioning to improve accessibility.
   - **Simple Harmonic Oscillator Fitting**: Delve into the '/simple_harmonic_oscillator' directory for the code related to fitting the Simple Harmonic Oscillator model.
   - **Mass Transfer Function Fitting**: The '/mass_transfer_function' directory contains more complex code for fitting the Mass Transfer Function to the data.

2. **Refer to Documentation**:
   Head over to the '/docs' directory for comprehensive documentation on data analysis procedures, parameter tuning, and troubleshooting.

3. **Experiment with Examples**:
   Check the '/examples' directory for sample datasets and walkthroughs. These examples will guide you through using the data analysis tools in practical scenarios.
