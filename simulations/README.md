# AFM Cantilever Vibration Simulations

Welcome to the "AFM Cantilever Vibration Simulations" directory! 

This repository hosts COMSOL Multiphysics simulation files specifically tailored to the vibration analysis of an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) cantilever with a spherical cell attached at the tip.

## Overview

In this directory, you'll find simulation files (*.mph) created using COMSOL Multiphysics, emphasizing the vibration behavior of an AFM cantilever interacting with a spherical cell. 

These simulations provide insights into the dynamic response, resonant frequencies, and mechanical interactions between the cantilever and the attached cell.

## Contents

The repository is organized into subdirectories, each representing different aspects or variations of the AFM cantilever and cell configurations. 

Explore the simulation files to gain a deeper understanding of the vibrational dynamics in various scenarios.

## Prerequisites

Before running the simulations, ensure that you have COMSOL Multiphysics installed on your system. Refer to the COMSOL documentation for installation and usage instructions.

## Usage

1. **Navigate to the Desired Subdirectory:**
   - Enter the specific subdirectory relevant to your area of interest.

2. **Open the COMSOL Simulation File:**
   - Use COMSOL Multiphysics to open the simulation file (*.mph) corresponding to the simulation you want to explore.

3. **Explore and Modify:**
   - Interact with the simulation to observe results or make modifications based on your specific requirements.
