# Experimental Setup

Welcome to the **Experimental Setup** section of the **Cellular Vibration Analysis using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)** project. This directory is dedicated to storing PDF documents related to the experimental setup, including protocols for cantilever preparation, equipment used, and the overall setup of the AFM instrumentation.

## Purpose

The "experimental_setup" folder serves as a repository for PDF documents containing crucial information about the experimental setup procedures. This includes detailed protocols for preparing cantilevers, information about the equipment used, and the setup configurations for conducting AFM experiments.

## Contents

The contents of this folder mainly consist of PDF documents, each providing valuable insights into different aspects of the experimental setup.

## Document Categories

- **Cantilever Preparation Protocols**: Explore PDF documents for detailed protocols on preparing cantilevers for AFM experiments.

- **Equipment Information**: Find PDFs containing information about the equipment used in the experiments, including specifications and setup guidelines.

- **Overall Setup Configuration**: Review PDFs for insights into the overall configuration of the AFM instrumentation during experiments.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to enhance the documentation of our experimental setup. If you have additional protocols or insights to share, please follow standard contribution guidelines.
